									<h3>Remziya Suleyman, Program Manager</h3>
								</div>
								
								<div class="entry-content">
									<p>Remziya’s commitment to being a positive catalyst in American politics started at the age of six when her family arrived in the United States as Kurdish refugees. A nationally recognized activist, Remziya has worked extensively to bring the voice of minority communities to the forefront of public discourse. A political expert on Kurdish and immigrant communities in the United States, she has developed a rapport with politicians, journalists, and a diverse range of citizens with varying political views.
									<br><br>
									In 2012, Remziya co-founded and served as Director of Policy for the American Center for Outreach (ACO), a political advocacy organization based in Tennessee. Remziya worked to successfully defeat dozens of divisive public policies and contributed to the drafting of several pieces of state legislation designed to enhance the quality of life for new Americans. During her tenure leading ACO and prior work with the Tennessee Immigrant & Refugee Rights Coalition (TIRRC), Remziya was the only Kurdish lobbyist in the state. She learned to effectively navigate the political process using diplomacy and influence, demonstrating to state and local representatives that the new American electorate was an instrumental voting bloc that needed to be engaged. Remziya’s work helped to highlight emerging policy trends facing new American communities. Her advocacy work has garnered her numerous accolades, and numerous US and international media outlets have documented her achievements.
									<br><br>
									Remziya’s activism and leadership in the Kurdish-American community took her to Washington, D.C. in 2014, where she served in the Kurdistan Regional Government’s de- facto diplomatic mission in the United States. In her capacity as the Director of Congressional and Academic Affairs, she was the Representative’s principal staff for drafting, maintaining and developing the Kurdistan Regional Government’s Congressional outreach and enhancing relations with U.S. based think tanks, universities, academic experts, business people and the Canadian government.
									<br><br>
									Remziya holds a Masters in Public Administration from Tennessee State University. She brings over 10 years of experience in government relations, political advocacy, policy analysis, administration, crisis management, PR/strategic communications and organizational leadership to her work with clients as an independent consultant.</p>

Too often, our community/ interfaith outreach efforts are designed to speak in ways in which we want to be heard and understood without fully understanding how our messages are actually being received. I am excited to be a part of a team that has the tools, know-how, and the relationships for us to break through these barriers in meaningful, effective ways.”</i></p>

									<p>I am a junior at Sewanee: The University of the South majoring in Political Science and minoring in Philosophy. I am currently conducting an independent research study investigating the impact of Christian identity on the politics of the American South and how this contributes to the growing polarization of the region and the rest of the country. At Sewanee, I founded and currently preside as President of the Sewanee Democrats Society, a political organization which seeks to not only provide a space for Democratic students to converse about politics amongst peers, organize events and work with other political/civic engagement organizations to foster a more politically aware community at Sewanee. I hope to do so by promoting political discourse and facilitating dialogues across differences under the guide of Ecce Quam Bonum—the University’s motto—hailed from Psalms 33: “Behold how good and pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!”. I hope to utilize the College’s motto of unity as a way to reach Sewanee students and encourage them to have civil discourse amongst their peers without fear of letting their political differences divide them. I hope to help the Sewanee community transcend political divides, and will apply my passion for depolarization to my work at Millions by researching the effects of disinformation on polarization in the country as a whole. In doing so, I aim to facilitate provocative conversations that dismantle political barriers and transform the new generation of voters. </p>
